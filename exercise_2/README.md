# Exercise 2 - Counting the Number of Characters

## Example Output

```
$ What's the input string? LC
LC has 2 characters.

```

## Constraints
- The output must contain the original string.
- Use 1 output statement to build the output.
- Use Ruby's built-in method to find the length of the string.

## Challenges
* If no data is entered, tell the user they need to enter something.
* Implement a graphical interface that updates the character count each time a key is pressed.
